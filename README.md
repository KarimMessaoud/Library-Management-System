<h2>Description</h2>
An integrated library system to lend and manage library assets. The software helps to control all the library items, for example,
what patrons have what assets, what patrons have certain items on hold.
It also helps to track the different branches that belong to the library. 
Various people might sign up for a library card within the system. The application allows to store necessary information of all users
and charge their fees as well. 
The system  automatically checks whether the patrons who have placed hold on some library assets have checked them out in the set time limit
or not and then sends them emails with the respective information.
The application has also automatic email confirmation to members on successful registration
and automatic email sending when resetting password by users. </br>
This project was inspired by Wes Doyle ASP.NET Core Web App Tutorial on YouTube which was also very helpful to build this application at the beginnig of my work.
